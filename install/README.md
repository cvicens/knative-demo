# Knative installation on GKE and Minishift

Here I have gathered some scripting for GKE and also for Minishift.

For a thorough explanation of each step regarding:

* GKE go [here](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/install/Knative-with-GKE.md)
* Minishift go [here](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/install/Knative-with-Minishift.md)

If you want to run the demos in this repo (and you don't have already a knative-ready cluster) follow the scripts in order under the corresponding folder. Hopefully the names of these folders are self-explanatory :-)
