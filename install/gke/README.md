# Warning!

This procedure, consisting in a set of scripts which will be run in order will end up with a live kubernetes cluster running in GCP and it will entail costs, please use wisely.

At the end of the demo or at any time you can use `ZZ-clean-up.sh` to delete the cluster and optionally the GCP project.
